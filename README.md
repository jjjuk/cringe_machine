# The Notebook

### And the idea is...

**A seasoned developer will have no difficulty with any new technology they have never used in production before.**

> Hire an engineer, not a notebook.

[I](https://github.com/jjjuk) promise you, there is no such thing as the *"right"* way to code.
What we should do is solve a problem in the simplest and most efficient way, rather than in the *"right"* way.
It has nothing to do with programming paradigms or design patterns, and every experienced programmer understands that.
**Most of the time, the stack is just a matter of preference.**


We can't change your mind, but we can show you the notebook.
We know exactly how it works; we've done this before. We can assure you that there is nothing special or difficult about it, nor any new technology that will become the industry standard later on.
And you can check your boxes and decide.


This repository will change to align with the latest trends in development.
